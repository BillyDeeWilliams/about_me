    <p> William "Surround Sound" Madden was born somewhere between El Paso Texas and Tucson Arizona on<br>
        an unusually gusty night when the white sands of the new Mexican plains rose up to enshroud the desert in mysterious pallor. <br>
        Traded as an infant by his adopted guardian for pornography and tobacco to an infertile shaman and his beautiful wife, <br>
        William has always been destine for adventure and intrigue.<br>
        His shaman parents' imparted upon the boy at a young age the importance of Magic and Style. Today, William uses these qualities today to create magnificent <br>
        mindscapes, and other terrifying realities with a myriad different kinds of meida, ranging from spray pain to exotic insect husks.<br>
        Having just returned to the Great Northwestern forests of Cascadia from his many recent shows abroad, Williams art has been praised by locals and dubbed<br>
        "pretty cool" by scholars of the trade (the latter, of course, being shrewd boring people).  </p>
