    <p> William "Surround Sound" Madden was born somewhere between El Paso Texas and Tucson Arizona on an unusually gusty night when the white sands of the new Mexican plains rose up to enshroud the desert in mysterious pallor. <br> Traded as an infant by his adopted guardian for pornography and tobacco to an infertile shaman and his beautiful wife, William has always been destine for adventure and intrigue.<br>
    His shaman parents' imparted upon the boy at a young age the importance of Magic and Style. William uses these qualities today to create magnificent  mindscapes and other terrifying realities with a myriad different kinds of meida, from spray pain to exotic insect husks.<br>
    Having just returned to the Great Northwestern forests of Cascadia from his many recent shows abroad, Williams art has been praised by locals and dubbed "pretty cool" by scholars of the trade (the latter, of course, being shrewd boring people).  </p>
