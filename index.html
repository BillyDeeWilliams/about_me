    <p>To tell my story it is necessary to tell the story of my birth.</p>
    <p> Born to and quickly abandoned by a pack of traveling Somethings of the Void who had been slightly inconvenienced and ensnared in what is, in the United States, called The Land of Enchantment, or New Mexico. They were able to cause quite a ruckus in that little corner of this world before things got put right and they found their way, and mostly everything got put back right, but their influence on the people who lived in that place before they left can never be undone. Just as the last of them to leave left behind a little bundle of mostly-human baby boy in the desert that landed in the winter of 1986 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He blew in over the mesa, came in with the first rays of the New Morning Sun, opened his eyes for the first time, like a flower in defiance of the rain; in a stream of light and sound and an explosion of all the necessary pieces of cause and effect happening to each other at the right time to make a new person. It was January 13th, and by that night the little bundle of mostly human boy had been recovered, discovered, and adopted into a passing caravan of bee-keeping gypsies heading further south to rendezvous with their herd of honey bees, who were wintering near the equator.  </p>

    </p>Such were the events surround my own strange origin, and why you'll understand I'm sure, when I reply to a close friend as I would a perfect stranger that, "I've really no idea who or what my parents truly were and I think they can proudly say  and often do the same of me" .  </p>
